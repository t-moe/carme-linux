Eclipse Support
============================

## Overview

Eclipse CDT integrates seamlessly with makefile projects. Furthermore you can flash your target and debug it using eclipse (via gdb).

## Installation

- Install eclipse (normal package)
- Run the script install.sh. It will install CDT and the required plugins to get you started.
- Now just import the example project as "existing project" and you're ready to go.


## Known Issues / Remarks

If you rename the project in either the makefile and/or eclipse you need to ajust the pathes of the debug configuration.

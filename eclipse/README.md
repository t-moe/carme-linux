Eclipse Support
============================

## Overview

Eclipse CDT integrates seamlessly with makefile projects. Furthermore you can flash your target and debug it using eclipse (via gdb).

## Eclipse Installation

- Install eclipse (normal package)
- Run the script install.sh. It will install CDT and the required plugins to get you started.

## How to use
- Copy the example project to your desired location and import it into eclipse as "existing project".
- Open the C/C++ Perspective
- You can compile the code normally by pressing the "build" button. Our makefile is used in the background.
- To download the code you have to press the "debug" button. Make sure the st-util deamon is running beforehand. (Start it with "make start")
- To debug the SFR's you can use the embsysregview plugin. [Tutorial](http://embsysregview.sourceforge.net/content/install3.html) 


## Known Issues / Remarks

- If you rename the project in either the makefile and/or eclipse you need to ajust the pathes of the debug configuration.
- Eclipse shows an error when you try to debug and st-util is not started or has crashed. Use "make start/stop" to reconnect.
- The code analyzer in eclipse is separated form the compiler. You may see lines marked with an error although they would compile just fine. Check that the Include directories are correct in the project properties (search for "Paths and Symbols")
- Stepping **over** a for loop will cause the debugger to hang. This is a bug in st_link.
